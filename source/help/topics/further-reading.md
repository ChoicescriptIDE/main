## Further Reading

The CSIDE help docs give you a general overview of the features of the application and basics of ChoiceScript, but before long you'll no doubt want answers to even more questions, questions which we unfortunately don't have the time nor expertise to answer here. This page is a
modest collection of some incredibly useful and informative links we've compiled that should help you on your way to finding the answers to those questions.


### Official Resources

### Community Resources

**[ChoiceScript Wikia](http://choicescriptdev.wikia.com/wiki/ChoiceScript_Wiki "ChoiceScriptDev Wikia")**

A good collection of various topics about ChoiceScript development, written entirely by other ChoiceScript developers. It contains things from extended descriptions of each command through to explanations of different coding and
testing practices. As it's volunteer driven some pages can often become out of date, so be wary of that, but the vast majority will still prove invaluable.

A very comprehensive and easy-to-use web-application that provides information on all kinds of things ChoiceScript.

**[RETowers' Basic ChoiceScript Guide](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45314691/CSGuide.html "RETowers' ChoiceScript Guide")**

A basic guide to ChoiceScript (that is itself written in the same language). A great starting point for newcomers to both the language and/or world of interactive fiction.
