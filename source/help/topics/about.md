## About

The Choicescript Integrated Development Environment (CSIDE) is a piece of software designed to aid people in developing interactive novels (or games) using the ChoiceScript scripting language, developed by Dan Fabulich of Choice of Games LLC. CSIDE is a third-party product developed independently by CJW (of the CoG Forums); it is maintained and supported by volunteers known as 'The CSIDE Team'. IN NO WAY is CSIDE officially endorsed by, or representative of, Choice of Games LLC. ChoiceScript is © Dan Fabulich.
