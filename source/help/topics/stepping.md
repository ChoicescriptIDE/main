## Stepping

CSIDE's Stepping function allows you to procedurally step through your game's code one line at a time, helping you closely monitor and analyse each line of your code. Together with the [Console](topics/console.md "Console") log, which will display variable changes as they occur, Stepping provides an effective, efficient way to find and correct any logic errors in your code.

To active the Stepping function, select the 'Start Stepping' button at the top of the Game Tab Panel, beside the standard 'Show Stats' and 'Restart' buttons. When Stepping is activated, the button will change to 'Stop Stepping'.

Stepping also reveals an adjacent 'Step' button. The 'Step' button is used to proceed through the code one line at a time. 'Start Stepping' and 'Stop Stepping' can be toggled on and off at any time during a play-test.

When Stepping is active, the Code Editor window switches scenes as needed to display the line of code being executed on each click of the 'Step' button. The active line of code is indicated by an arrow next to the line number, to the left of the display. The Code Editor will automatically attempt to load any closed scene files it needs in order to properly display the line of code that is currently active.

Stepping slows down the processing of your game code to let you to check for errors. Note that the play-test game is still running in the Game Tab Panel. To proceed at at *choice or a *input_text box, you will need to interact with the game in a normal fashion, as a player would, by choosing an #option, clicking 'Next', inputting text, etc..
