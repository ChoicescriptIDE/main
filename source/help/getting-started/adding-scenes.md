## Adding Scenes

All ChoiceScript games have two mandatory scenes: the 'startup' scene and the 'choicescript_stats' scene. CSIDE creates these two scenes for you automatically whenever you start a new project; then you're free to add as many more scenes as you like.

### How to Add Scenes

To add a new scene to your project, click the '+' icon on that project's header bar. This will create and open a new 'untitled' scene file, and automatically save it into the new project's folder.

You can rename your additional scene files at any time by double-clicking them. If you already have a scene file selected, a single click will let you rename it. You cannot rename or delete, the two compulsory ChoiceScript files ('startup' and 'choicescript_stats').


### Scene Limitations & Structure

There is no technical limit on the number of scenes you can create. However, it is important to find a good balance between scene quantity, length, and overall game structure.

If this is your first foray into developing ChoiceScript games, there are a couple of older but very useful articles which can give you some pointers for planning your game's design:
