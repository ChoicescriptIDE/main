First and foremost, we would like to thank Choice of Games LLC, consisting of Jason Stevan Hill, Adam Morse, ChoiceScript's creator Dan Fabulich, and the rest of their ever-growing team. Thank you for providing us with a fresh, growing, and ever-improving selection of high-quality multiple choice games. Thank you for being champions of equality. And finally, thank you for creating ChoiceScript and supporting the growth of such a very special community.

We would also like to thank that same community: the forum-goers, writers, editors, beta testers, and game-players, and even those of you who haven't joined us quite yet. Without you, the fans, there would be no games—there would be no ChoiceScript. There would be no CSIDE. Thank you to all, past, present, and future supporters, pioneers of all that we do and stand for. It has been, and will continue to be, our pleasure to be a part of it all.

Of course, no thank you list could ever be complete without mentioning 'The CSIDE Team'—the only fitting name. Four years is a very long time to work alone on a side project of this magnitude, without pay, without a clear goal, and with no finish line in sight. Between life, work, and my studies, it would have been very easy to give up on this project, way back before it had barely even begun. It would have been simpler to leave it as that simple textbox on a website that you could paste some ChoiceScript code into.

From the very beginning, from a featureless, bug-ridden experiment to a feature-full, (slightly less) buggy application, they saw the potential in CSIDE and carried it with me through the years—through productive times and quiet times, hard times and easy times, the joy and the pain. In no particular order, by their Choice of Games forum handles:

  - Vendetta
  - Fiogan
  - Nocturnal_Stillness
  - fantom
  - LordIrish
  - Shockbolt

Thank you all, for everything.

To all the other beta-testers who weren't with us all the way, you know who you are, and you also have our heartfelt thanks for all the parts you played, big or small.
There really isn't a single person, organisation, resource, or entity listed on this page that CSIDE, in its current form, could have existed without. It really wouldn't be half the program it is today without every last one of you.

We hope you enjoy using CSIDE just as much as we did creating it.

Happy scripting,

The CSIDE Team!
