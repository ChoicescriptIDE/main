title: What is CSIDE?
---

CSIDE (the ChoiceScript Integrated Development Environment) is just that—an integrated development environment for the [ChoiceScript](https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/ "Introduction to ChoiceScript") scripting language.


## What does that mean?

Don't worry; we promise it's not complicated. Basically, CSIDE is a piece of software (a computer application) that is designed to provide you with all the tools you need to develop interactive fiction games with ChoiceScript.

CSIDE provides a way to manage your files, write your stories, and test your game scripting, all in one neat package! It includes features designed to streamline the entire creation process and take out every possible hardship or chore, leaving only the fun bits for you.

From the second your fingers first touch the keyboard to the moment you're finally ready to click 'Export' and publish that blockbuster game, CSIDE is here to help you on every step of the way.


## So I need to be a programmer to use this, huh?

Absolutely not! Most ChoiceScript authors have little or no programming experience, only passion and skill in writing great stories. CSIDE is designed with writers in mind, in order to make learning and using ChoiceScript an easy, satisfying experience.


## Really? I dunno...

If you're still uncertain, or if you aren't sure what ChoiceScript is, check out the website of its creators: [Choice of Games LLC](https://www.choiceofgames.com "Choice of Games LLC"). Try playing some of the free games or trial chapters, developed by people just like you using ChoiceScript. Once you've seen what ChoiceScript is, and what interactive fiction authors can use it to do, we're confident this will all make a lot more sense!

Happy scripting!
